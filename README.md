![RESTPHP - A basic BoilerPlate to start building your RestFull Application](logo.jpg)

# RESTPHP

RESTPHP is an extremely simple and easy to understand skeleton PHP application, reduced to the max.
It is not a framework but rather a boilerplate to begin your Restfull Application.
If you just want to show some pages, do a few database calls and a little-bit of AJAX here and there, without
reading in massive documentations of highly complex professional frameworks.
